Description: Robust Cell Type Decomposition (RCTD) is a computational method for
    deconvolving cell type mixtures in spatial transcriptomics data. RCTD
    learns cell type profiles from annotated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
    reference data and uses these profiles to identify cell types in spatial
    transcriptomic pixels while accounting for platform-specific effects. The
    package provides three analysis modes: doublet detection (up to 2 cell types
    per pixel), multi mode with greedy cell type assignment (up to a specified
    number of cell types per pixel), and full decomposition without
    restrictions. This is the Bioconductor version of the original spacexr
    package, which can be found here: https://github.com/dmcable/spacexr. Future
    releases will include an implementation of CSIDE.
