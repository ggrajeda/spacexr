Description: Spatial-eXpression-R (spacexr) is a package for analyzing cell
    types in spatial transcriptomics data. This implementation is a fork of the
    spacexr GitHub repo (https://github.com/dmcable/spacexr), adapted to work
    with Bioconductor objects. The original package implements two statistical
    methods: RCTD for learning cell types and CSIDE for inferring cell
    type-specific differential expression. Currently, this fork only implements
    RCTD, which learns cell type profiles from annotated RNA sequencing
    (RNA-seq) reference data and uses these profiles to identify cell types in
    spatial transcriptomic pixels while accounting for platform-specific
    effects. Future releases will include an implementation of CSIDE.
