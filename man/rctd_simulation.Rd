\title{Simulated Spatial Transcriptomics Dataset}
\format{
A list containing five components:
\describe{
  \item{reference_counts}{A matrix of simulated reference counts with 750
  rows (genes) and 75 columns (25 samples per cell type). Gene names are of
  the form "g1", "g2", etc.}
  \item{reference_cell_types}{A named factor specifying the cell type
  ("ct1", "ct2", "ct3") for each reference sample.}
  \item{spatial_rna_coords}{A data frame with columns 'x' and 'y' giving the
  coordinates of each spatial transcriptomics pixel.}
  \item{spatial_rna_counts}{A matrix of simulated spatial transcriptomics
  counts with 750 rows (genes) and 12 columns (spatial locations).}
  \item{proportions_se}{A SummarizedExperiment object containing the true
  cell type proportions for each spatial location. The 'weights' assay
  contains a matrix with 12 rows (spatial locations) and 3 columns
  (cell types).}
}

rctd_simulation
}
\description{
A simulated dataset containing both reference single-cell RNA-seq data and
spatial transcriptomics data. The dataset includes 750 genes across 3 cell
types, with 50% of genes being differentially expressed between cell types.
The spatial data consists of two types of mixtures, documented below.
}
\details{
The dataset was generated using the following parameters:
\itemize{
  \item 750 genes, with 50% probability of differential expression
  \item 3 cell types with 25 reference samples each
  \item 12 spatial locations total:
  \itemize{
    \item 6 locations with mixture type 1 (90% ct1, 10% ct2)
    \item 6 locations with mixture type 2 (20% ct1, 40% ct2, 40% ct3)
  }
}

Base expression levels were sampled uniformly between 0 and 10.
Differentially expressed genes were randomly selected to be either
up-regulated (2x) or down-regulated (0.5x) in specific cell types.
Final counts were generated using a Poisson distribution.
