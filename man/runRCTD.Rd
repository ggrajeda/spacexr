\description{
Runs the RCTD algorithm to decompose cell type mixtures in spatial
transcriptomics data. For each pixel in the spatial data, RCTD estimates the
proportions of different cell types by comparing the gene expression at a
pixel to the reference cell type profiles, while accounting for technical
factors like platform effects and varying sequencing depth. The algorithm has
three modes suited for different spatial technologies:
\itemize{
  \item \code{doublet}: Fits at most two cell types per pixel and classifies
    each pixel as a \code{"singlet"} (one cell type) or \code{"doublet"}
    (two cell types). Best for high spatial resolution technologies like
    Slide-seq or MERFISH, where pixels are more likely to contain only 1 or
    2 cells.
  \item \code{multi}: Uses a greedy algorithm to fit up to
    \code{MAX_MULTI_TYPES} cell types per pixel (default: 4). Best for lower
    resolution technologies like 100-micron Visium spots, which can contain
    more cell types.
  \item \code{full}: Fits any number of cell types per pixel without
    restrictions.
